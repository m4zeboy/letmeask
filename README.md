## App functions

Anyone can create a room. After create a room, the system generates a room code so that the admin can share it with their audience, then, the user becomes the admin Room, and with that receive some hits.

**ADMIN HITS**
* Share Room Code;
* End Room;
* Mark question as replied; Highlight the question and Delete the question.

Invited Users can make questions and like questions from other people, and also share the room code.
